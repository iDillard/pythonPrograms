# Tax Calculator
This program is simple becuase it calculates tax.

The main reason for this program is to show my understanding implementing GUI using python
This program uses tkinter to make the UI. 

A total of 5 rows in GUI
The first row is where the user will enter total, "Total Purchase", into a text box
The second row is where the user will enter the "Tax Rate" into a Text box. 
The next two rows are solo for displaying information. The "Sales Total" is printed on row 3 and "Amout Due" is printed on the row 4
The 5th and finale row consist of two buttons "Calculate" and "Quit"
The calculate button will perform the math run the program.
Quit will exit the program
